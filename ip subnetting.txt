IP subnetting
Ip address : 192.168.10.1

1./26 subnet:
host bits :6(32 bits -26 =6)
network bits :26
subnet calculation:
total subnets=2^2=4(because we are taking 2 bits from host)
total hosts per subnet = 2^6-2=64-2 =>62
Network Address: 192.168.10.0
first usable IP: 192.168.10.1
Last usable Ip: 192.168.10.62
Broadcast Address:192.168.10.63

2. /28
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.240(/28)
network bits :28
Host bits: 4(32-28=4)
Calculation:
Total subnets: 2^4=16bits(because we are taking 4bits from host)
Total hosts: 2^4-2=>16-2=>14
Network address:192.168.10.0
First usable IP:192.168.10.1

3. /29
Subnet mask:255.255.255.248
Network bits:29
Host bits:3(32-29=>3)
Calculation:
Total subnets: 2^5=>32(we are taking 5bits from host)
Total hosts: 2^3-2=>8-2=>6
